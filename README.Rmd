"Waywiser" is an old-timey name for a [surveyor's wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveyor%27s_wheel), a device that makes measuring long distances easier than with measurement tools like a ruler or yardstick. The waywiser R package makes measuring model performance on spatial data easier, extending the [yardstick](https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/) R package to incorporate measures of spatial autocorrelation provided by [sfdep](https://sfdep.josiahparry.com/).

Please note that this package is highly experimental. The user-facing API is likely to change without deprecation warnings up until the first CRAN release.

## Installation

You can install the development version of waywiser from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mikemahoney218/waywiser")
```

## Example

Let's walk through how we can use waywiser to find local indicators of spatial autocorrelation for a very simple model, looking at how tree canopy coverage impacts temperature in Boston, Massachusetts. First things first, let's load a few libraries:

```{r}
# waywiser itself, of course:
library(waywiser)
# For the %>% pipe and mutate:
library(dplyr)
```

We'll be working with the `guerry` data from the sfdep package, fitting a linear model to associate crimes against persons with literacy. Let's load the data now:

```{r}
data(guerry, package = "sfdep")
```

waywiser builds on top of the [sfdep](https://sfdep.josiahparry.com/) package, itself an extension for the [spdep](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/index.html) spatial dependence library. These packages expect you to have objects representing the neighbors of your data set and the spatial weights between observations. 

As a result, right now waywiser also expects you to already have those objects pre-created and to pass them as arguments to model metric functions. We'll find the neighbors in our data using the `st_contiguity()` function, and then calculate spatial weights via `st_weights()`:

```{r}
nb <- st_contiguity(guerry)
wt <- st_weights(nb)
```

With our spatial relationships defined, we can now fit a model and calculate spatial dependency in our model residuals! 

We'll fit a simple linear model relating crimes against persons with literacy, and then generate predictions from that model. We can use `ww_local_moran_i()` to calculate the local spatial autocorrelation of our residuals at each data point:

```{r}
guerry %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(lm(crime_pers ~ literacy, .))) %>% 
  ww_local_moran_i(crime_pers, pred, nb, wt)
```

Or if we use `ww_local_moran_i_vec`, we can add a column to our original data frame with our statistic, which makes plotting using our original geometries easier:

```{r 2022_06_28-guerry}
library(ggplot2)

guerry %>%
  mutate(pred = predict(lm(crime_pers ~ literacy, .)),
         .estimate = ww_local_moran_i_vec(crime_pers, pred, nb, wt)) %>% 
  mutate(
    cut_points = case_when(
      .estimate <= -1 ~ "(-Inf, -1]",
      .estimate <= -0.5 ~ "(-1, -0.5]",
      .estimate <= 0 ~ "(-0.5, 0]",
      .estimate <= 0.5 ~ "(0, 0.5]",
      .estimate <= 1 ~ "(0.5, 1]",
      .estimate > 1 ~ "(1, Inf)",
    ),
    cut_points = factor(
      cut_points,
      rev(
        c(
          "(-Inf, -1]", 
          "(-1, -0.5]", 
          "(-0.5, 0]", 
          "(0, 0.5]", 
          "(0.5, 1]", 
          "(1, Inf)")
      )
    )
  ) %>% 
  sf::st_as_sf() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fill = .estimate)) +
  geom_sf() + 
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "#018571", mid = "white", high = "#A6611A")
```

This makes it easy to see what areas are poorly represented by our model, which might lead us to identify ways to improve our model or help us identify caveats and limitations of the models we're working with.
