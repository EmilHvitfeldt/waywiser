Description: Predictive models of spatial data may have spatially
    structured errors, with "hot spots" of higher than expected error
    clustered geographically due to spatial structure in the underlying
    data. These functions provide methods for measuring the spatial
    structure of model errors for models, and are particularly useful for
    models fit using the 'tidymodels' framework.
